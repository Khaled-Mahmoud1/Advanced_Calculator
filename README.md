# ===== Advanced_Calculator =====

A console-based **Advanced Calculator** built using **Java (Procedural Programming style)**.  
This project is designed as a college assignment focusing on **functions, loops, conditions, input validation**, and **menu-driven programs**, without using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

##  Project Overview

The Advanced Calculator allows the user to perform multiple mathematical and utility operations through a simple text-based menu.  
The project emphasizes clean code structure, error handling, and safe user input.

##  Features

-  Basic Arithmetic Operations  
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division (with division-by-zero protection)

-  Average Calculation for multiple numbers

-  Square Root Calculation  
  - Handles negative numbers safely

-  Power Calculation (x^y)

- ! Factorial Calculation  
  - Prevents overflow by limiting input to 20

-  Temperature Conversion  
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit  
  - Celsius ↔ Kelvin  
  - Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin

-  Currency Conversion  
  - Uses a custom conversion rate entered by the user

-  Number Guessing Game  
  - Limited number of attempts  
  - Helpful hints (Higher / Lower)

-  Sub-menus with "Back" option

-  Exit confirmation for safe program termination

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Java**
- Java Standard Library (`java.util.Scanner`)
- Console-based input/output

---

##  Programming Style

- Procedural Programming
- No Object-Oriented concepts used
  - No objects
  - No constructors
  - No inheritance
- All logic implemented using:
  - `static methods`
  - loops
  - conditions


---
## Input Validation & Error Handling

 - Prevents invalid numeric input

 - Handles division by zero

 - Prevents factorial overflow

 - Ensures safe menu navigation

 - Confirms before exiting the program

##  How to Run the Program

### 1- Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher installed
- Command Prompt / Terminal

### 2- Compile the program
- javac AdvancedCalculator.java
